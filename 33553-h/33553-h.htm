Introduction
</H3>

<P CLASS="noindent">
Most of the poems contained in this collection are of recent date,
though their author&mdash;who is at present Professor of Modern Languages at
Bishop's College, Quebec&mdash;has written verse from his childhood.  He is
the first Canadian writer to be included in this series, and is as
affectionately loyal to the Motherland as to his native country, as may
be gathered from his "Song of the Homeland."  His verse has already
earned a considerable reputation in Canada, in whose Press much of it
has appeared.  Educated at Stanstead College, he took his degree at the
University where he now lectures, and has also studied in Paris,
Marburg and Switzerland.  Several of his poems are concerned with the
sorrow and the ravished beauty of Belgium: a circumstance not
surprising, as he has travelled much in that country, as well as in
France, Switzerland and Italy.  A lover of country life and a disciple
of the cult of the open road, he revels in the joys of camping and
canoeing, as one of his poems, "Hidden Treasure," bears witness.  In
this little book, and more especially in the "Song of the Homeland," he
shows us the maple leaf entwined, strongly as ever, with the English
rose of the Mother country.

<P CLASS="poem">
Once in a Belgian garden,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">(Ah, many months ago!)</SPAN><BR>
I saw like pale Madonnas<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The tall white lilies blow.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Great poplars swayed and trembled<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Afar against the sky,</SPAN><BR>
And green with flags and rushes<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The river wandered by.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Amid the waving wheatfields<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Glowed poppies blazing red,</SPAN><BR>
And showering strange wild music<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">A lark rose overhead.</SPAN><BR>

<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 10%; letter-spacing: 2em">*****</SPAN><BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
The lark has ceased his singing,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The wheat is trodden low,</SPAN><BR>
And in the blood-stained garden<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">No more the lilies blow.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And where green poplars trembled<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Stand shattered trunks instead,</SPAN><BR>
And lines of small white crosses<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Keep guard above the dead.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
For here brave lads and noble,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">From lands beyond the deep,</SPAN><BR>
Beneath the small white crosses<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Have laid them down to sleep.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
They laid them down with gladness<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Upon the alien plain,</SPAN><BR>
That this same Belgian garden<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Might bud and bloom again.</SPAN><BR>

Long the eastern beaches,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Where brown the seaweed grows,</SPAN><BR>
And over broad salt meadows,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The green tide ebbs and flows.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Above the low-roofed houses,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Two ancient towers rise,</SPAN><BR>
And stand like giant druids,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Against the wind-swept skies.</SPAN><BR>

Through mist or rain or sunshine,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Their prows festooned with foam,</SPAN><BR>
The fishing-boats go outward<BR>

She sees not tide or tempest,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Or sun or mist or rain;</SPAN><BR>
Afar her spirit wanders<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Upon the Belgian plain.</SPAN><BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Where over shell-scarred cities<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The mad, red tempest raves,</SPAN><BR>

Hidden Treasure<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Sun-browned boy with the wondering eyes,<BR>
Do you see the blue of the summer skies?<BR>
Do you hear the song of the drowsy stream,<BR>
As it winds by the shore where the birches gleam?<BR>
Then come, come away<BR>
From the shadowy bay,<BR>
And we'll drift with the stream where the rapids play;<BR>
For we are two pirates, fierce and bold,<BR>
And we'll capture the hoard of the morning's gold.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A roving craft is our red canoe,<BR>
O pirate chief with the eyes of blue;<BR>
So hoist your flag with the skull on high,<BR>
And out we'll sail where the treasures lie.<BR>
For in days of old<BR>
Came pirates bold,<BR>
a Spanish galleon's captured gold;<BR>
And their boat was wrecked on the river strand<BR>
And its treasures strewn on the silver sand.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now steady all as we dash along,<BR>
The rapids are swift but our paddles are strong;<BR>
And soon we'll drift with the water's flow<BR>
Where the treasure lies hid in the shallows below,<BR>
Oh, cool and dim,<BR>
'Neath its foam-flecked brim,<BR>
Is the pool where the swallows dip and skim;<BR>
So we'll plunge by the prow of our red canoe<BR>
For the treasure that lies in the quivering blue.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now home once more to the shadowy bay,<BR>
For we've captured the gold of the summer's day,<BR>
And emeralds green from the banks along,<BR>
And the silver bars of the white-throat's song.<BR>
No pirates bore<BR>
Such a glittering store<BR>
From the treasure ships of the days of yore,<BR>
As the spoils we have won on the shining stream,<BR>
While we drifted along in a golden dream.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Red sunlight fades from wood and town,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The western sky is crimson-dyed,</SPAN><BR>
Gaunt shadow-ships drift silent down<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Upon the river's gleaming tide.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The hills' clear outlines melt away<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Or veil themselves in purple light,</SPAN><BR>
And burning thoughts that vexed the day<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Become fair visions of the night.</SPAN><BR>

The Madonna<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
She shivered and crouched in the immigrant shed<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">In the midst of the surging crowd;</SPAN><BR>
Her hands were warped with the years of toil,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And her young form bent and bowed.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Her eyes looked forth with a frightened glance<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">At the throng that round her pressed;</SPAN><BR>
But her face was the face of the Mother of God<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">As she looked at the babe on her breast.</SPAN><BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Old Lohan peers through the dusty glass,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">From a jumble of curios quaint and rare;</SPAN><BR>
And he watches the hurrying crowds that pass<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The whole day long, through the ancient square.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Wrapped in his robe of gold and jade,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Here by the window he patiently waits</SPAN><BR>
For the sound that the gongs and the conches made,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">In the days of old at the temple gates.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He heaves no sighs and he sheds no tears,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">For his heart is bronze, and he does not know</SPAN><BR>
That his temple has been for a thousand years<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">But a mound of dust where the bamboos grow.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
So here he sits through the nights and days,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And the sun goes up and down the sky;</SPAN><BR>
But he often looks with a wistful gaze<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">At the crowds that always pass him by.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And his eyes half closed in a mystic dream<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Of his poppy-land of long ago,</SPAN><BR>
Turn back to the shores of the sacred stream<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And the kneeling throng he used to know.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But he sometimes smiles as he sees the crowd<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Of human folk that pass him by;</SPAN><BR>
Then he wraps himself in his mystic shroud,&mdash;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And the sun once more goes down the sky.</SPAN><BR>

Through a Long Cloister<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Through a long cloister where the gloom of night<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Lingers in sombre silence all the day,</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Across worn pavements crumbling to decay</SPAN><BR>
We wandered, blindly groping for the light.<BR>
A door swung wide, and splendour infinite<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Streamed through the painted glass, and drove away</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The lingering gloom from choir, nave and bay,</SPAN><BR>
And a great minster's glory met our sight.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Blindly along life's cloister do we grope,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">We seek a gate that leads to life immortal,</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">We see it loom before us dim and vast,</SPAN><BR>
And doubt's dark shadows veil the light of hope:<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">When lo, Death's hand flings wide the sombre portal,</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">And light unfading meets our gaze at last.</SPAN><BR>

<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">Along the silent Richelieu;</SPAN><BR>

<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">A threatening cloud hung in the west.</SPAN><BR>

<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">No warning sound the river made</SPAN><BR>

<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">We saw a ghastly, gleaming light,&mdash;-</SPAN><BR>

The snowflakes fell on a mountain peak,<BR>
Where the rocks were bare and the winds were bleak,<BR>
And at first they clung to the mountain's breast,<BR>
But soon they fell from its lofty crest,<BR>
And stained and soiled was the new-born snow<BR>
When it reached the valley far down below.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
But up on the height one drift alone<BR>
Still firmly clung to the rugged stone,<BR>
And men in the gloomy vale below<BR>
Looked up and gazed on the shining snow,<BR>
And their darkened souls drank in the light<BR>
From the gleaming snow on the mountain height.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Unstained by the grime of the earthly vale,<BR>
Its white breast firm in the strongest gale,<BR>
It bravely clung to its lofty height<BR>

It rose in mist to the skies again.<BR>

The angel song; to touch my lips to thine,<BR>
